For data, you will need the following:
 - AllCards.json from mtgjson.com (contains data of all cards)
   https://mtgjson.com/downloads/compiled/
 - scryfall-oracle-cards.json from scryfall.com (contains image URLs of most recent versions of cards)
   https://archive.scryfall.com/json/scryfall-oracle-cards.json
 - run convert.js to generate creatures.json
TODO:
 - improve printing (node-native-printer doesn't work always)
